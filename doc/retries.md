# Retries

The retries mechanism allows to retry a failing operation according to a given policy (e.g. retry 3 times with a 100ms delay between attempts).

## API
The basic syntax for retries is:

```scala
import ox.retry.retry

retry(operation)(policy)
```

or, using a syntax sugar:

```scala
import ox.syntax.*

operation.retry(policy)
```

## Operation definition
The `operation` can be provided as one of:
- a direct by-name parameter, i.e. `f: => T`
- a by-name `Try[T]`, i.e. `f: => Try[T]`
- a by-name `Either[E, T]`, i.e. `f: => Either[E, T]`

## Policies

A retry policy consists of two parts:
- a `Schedule`, which indicates how many times and with what delay should we retry the `operation` after an initial failure,
- a `ResultPolicy`, which indicates whether:
  - a non-erroneous outcome of the `operation` should be considered a success (if not, the `operation` would be retried),
  - an erroneous outcome of the `operation` should be retried or fail fast.

The available schedules are defined in the `Schedule` object. Each schedule has a finite and an infinite variant.

### Finite schedules

Finite schedules have a common `maxRetries: Int` parameter, which determines how many times the `operation` would be retried after an initial failure. This means that the operation could be executed at most `maxRetries + 1` times. 

### Infinite schedules

Each finite schedule has an infinite variant, whose settings are similar to those of the respective finite schedule, but without the `maxRetries` setting. Using the infinite variant can lead to a possibly infinite number of retries (unless the `operation` starts to succeed again at some point). The infinite schedules are created by calling `.forever` on the companion object of the respective finite schedule (see examples below).

### Schedule types

The supported schedules (specifically - their finite variants) are:
- `Immediate(maxRetries: Int)` - retries up to `maxRetries` times without any delay between subsequent attempts.
- `Delay(maxRetries: Int, delay: FiniteDuration)` - retries up to `maxRetries` times , sleeping for `delay` between subsequent attempts.
- `Backoff(maxRetries: Int, initialDelay: FiniteDuration, maxDelay: FiniteDuration, jitter: Jitter)` - retries up to `maxRetries` times , sleeping for `initialDelay` before the first retry, increasing the sleep between subsequent attempts exponentially (with base `2`) up to an optional `maxDelay` (default: 1 minute). 

  Optionally, a random factor (jitter) can be used when calculating the delay before the next attempt. The purpose of jitter is to avoid clustering of subsequent retries, i.e. to reduce the number of clients calling a service exactly at the same time, which can result in subsequent failures, contrary to what you would expect from retrying. By introducing randomness to the delays, the retries become more evenly distributed over time. 

  See the [AWS Architecture Blog article on backoff and jitter](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/) for a more in-depth explanation. 

  The following jitter strategies are available (defined in the `Jitter` enum):
  - `None` - the default one, when no randomness is added, i.e. a pure exponential backoff is used,
  - `Full` - picks a random value between `0` and the exponential backoff calculated for the current attempt,
  - `Equal` - similar to `Full`, but prevents very short delays by always using a half of the original backoff and adding a random value between `0` and the other half,
  - `Decorrelated` - uses the delay from the previous attempt (`lastDelay`) and picks a random value between the `initalAttempt` and `3 * lastDelay`.

### Result policies

A result policy allows to customize how the results of the `operation` are treated. It consists of two predicates:
- `isSuccess: T => Boolean` (default: `true`) - determines whether a non-erroneous result of the `operation` should be considered a success. When it evaluates to `true` - no further attempts would be made, otherwise - we'd keep retrying.

  With finite schedules (i.e. those with `maxRetries` defined), if `isSuccess` keeps returning `false` when `maxRetries` are reached, the result is returned as-is, even though it's considered "unsuccessful",
- `isWorthRetrying: E => Boolean` (default: `true`) - determines whether another attempt would be made if the `operation` results in an error `E`. When it evaluates to `true` - we'd keep retrying, otherwise - we'd fail fast with the error.

The `ResultPolicy[E, T]` is generic both over the error (`E`) and result (`T`) type. Note, however, that for the direct and `Try` variants of the `operation`, the error type `E` is fixed to `Throwable`, while for the `Either` variant, `E` can ba an arbitrary type.

### API shorthands

When you don't need to customize the result policy (i.e. use the default one), you can use one of the following shorthands to define a retry policy with a given schedule (note that the parameters are the same as when manually creating the respective `Schedule`):
- `RetryPolicy.immediate(maxRetries: Int)`,
- `RetryPolicy.immediateForever`,
- `RetryPolicy.delay(maxRetries: Int, delay: FiniteDuration)`,
- `RetryPolicy.delayForever(delay: FiniteDuration)`,
- `RetryPolicy.backoff(maxRetries: Int, initialDelay: FiniteDuration, maxDelay: FiniteDuration, jitter: Jitter)`,
- `RetryPolicy.backoffForever(initialDelay: FiniteDuration, maxDelay: FiniteDuration, jitter: Jitter)`.

If you want to customize a part of the result policy, you can use the following shorthands:
- `ResultPolicy.default[E, T]` - uses the default settings,
- `ResultPolicy.successfulWhen[E, T](isSuccess: T => Boolean)` - uses the default `isWorthRetrying` and the provided `isSuccess`,
- `ResultPolicy.retryWhen[E, T](isWorthRetrying: E => Boolean)` - uses the default `isSuccess` and the provided `isWorthRetrying`,
- `ResultPolicy.neverRetry[E, T]` - uses the default `isSuccess` and fails fast on any error.

## Examples

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import ox.retry.retry
import ox.retry.{Jitter, ResultPolicy, RetryPolicy, Schedule}
import scala.concurrent.duration.*
import scala.util.Try

def directOperation: Int = ???
def eitherOperation: Either[String, Int] = ???
def tryOperation: Try[Int] = ???

// various operation definitions - same syntax
retry(directOperation)(RetryPolicy.immediate(3))
retry(eitherOperation)(RetryPolicy.immediate(3))
retry(tryOperation)(RetryPolicy.immediate(3))

// various policies with custom schedules and default ResultPolicy
retry(directOperation)(RetryPolicy.delay(3, 100.millis))
retry(directOperation)(RetryPolicy.backoff(3, 100.millis)) // defaults: maxDelay = 1.minute, jitter = Jitter.None
retry(directOperation)(RetryPolicy.backoff(3, 100.millis, 5.minutes, Jitter.Equal))

// infinite retries with a default ResultPolicy
retry(directOperation)(RetryPolicy.delayForever(100.millis))
retry(directOperation)(RetryPolicy.backoffForever(100.millis, 5.minutes, Jitter.Full))

// result policies
// custom success
retry(directOperation)(RetryPolicy(Schedule.Immediate(3), ResultPolicy.successfulWhen(_ > 0)))
// fail fast on certain errors
retry(directOperation)(RetryPolicy(Schedule.Immediate(3), ResultPolicy.retryWhen(_.getMessage != "fatal error")))
retry(eitherOperation)(RetryPolicy(Schedule.Immediate(3), ResultPolicy.retryWhen(_ != "fatal error")))
```
