/** A config that defines how to retry a failed operation.
  *
  * It is a special case of [[ScheduledConfig]] with [[ScheduledConfig.sleepMode]] always set to [[SleepMode.Delay]]
  *
  * @param schedule
  *   The retry schedule which determines the maximum number of retries and the delay between subsequent attempts to execute the operation.
  *   See [[Schedule]] for more details.
  * @param resultPolicy
  *   A policy that allows to customize when a non-erroneous result is considered successful and when an error is worth retrying (which
  *   allows for failing fast on certain errors). See [[ResultPolicy]] for more details.
  * @param onRetry
  *   A function that is invoked after each retry attempt. The callback receives the number of the current retry attempt (starting from 1)
  *   and the result of the operation that was attempted. The result is either a successful value or an error. The callback can be used to
  *   log information about the retry attempts, or to perform other side effects. By default, the callback does nothing.
  * @tparam E
  *   The error type of the operation. For operations returning a `T` or a `Try[T]`, this is fixed to `Throwable`. For operations returning
  *   an `Either[E, T]`, this can be any `E`.
  * @tparam T
  *   The successful result type for the operation.
