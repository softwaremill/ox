/** Starts a new scope, which allows starting forks in the given code block `f`. Forks can be started using [[fork]], [[forkUser]],
  * [[forkCancellable]] and [[forkUnsupervised]]. All forks are guaranteed to complete before this scope completes.
  *
  * The scope is ran in supervised mode, that is:
  *   - the scope ends once all user, supervised forks (started using [[forkUser]]), including the `f` main body, succeed. Forks started
  *     using [[fork]] (daemon) don't have to complete successfully for the scope to end.
  *   - the scope also ends once the first supervised fork (including the `f` main body) fails with an exception
  *   - when the scope ends, all running forks are cancelled
  *   - the scope completes (that is, this method returns) only once all forks started by `f` have completed (either successfully, or with
  *     an exception)
