  /*
  Implementation note: why we catch Throwable (a) at all, (b) why not NonFatal?
  As far (a), sea ADR #3.
  As for (b), in case there's an InterruptedException, we do catch it and propagate, but we also stop the fork.
  Propagating is needed as there might be downstream consumers, which are outside the scope, and would be otherwise
  unaware that producing from the source stopped. We also don't rethrow, as the scope is already winding down (as we're
  in a supervised scope, there's no other possibility to interrupt the fork).
