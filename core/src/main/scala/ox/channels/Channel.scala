/** Channel is a thread-safe data structure which exposes three basic operations:
  *
  *   - [[send]]-ing a value to the channel. Values can't be `null`.
  *   - [[receive]]-ing a value from the channel
  *   - closing the channel using [[done]] or [[error]]
  *
  * There are three channel flavors:
  *
  *   - rendezvous channels, where senders and receivers must meet to exchange values
  *   - buffered channels, where a given number of sent values might be buffered, before subsequent `send`s block
  *   - unlimited channels, where an unlimited number of values might be buffered, hence `send` never blocks
  *
  * Channels can be created using the channel's companion object. A rendezvous channel is created using [[Channel.rendezvous]]. A buffered
  * channel can be created either with a given capacity - by providing a positive integer to the [[Channel.buffered]] method - or with the
  * default capacity ([[StageCapacity.default]]) using [[Channel.bufferedDefault]] . A rendezvous channel behaves like a buffered channel
  * with buffer size 0. An unlimited channel can be created using [[Channel.unlimited]].
  *
  * In a rendezvous channel, senders and receivers block, until a matching party arrives (unless one is already waiting). Similarly,
  * buffered channels block if the buffer is full (in case of senders), or in case of receivers, if the buffer is empty and there are no
  * waiting senders.
  *
  * All blocking operations behave properly upon interruption.
  *
  * Channels might be closed, either because no more values will be produced by the source (using [[done]]), or because there was an error
  * while producing or processing the received values (using [[error]]).
  *
  * After closing, no more values can be sent to the channel. If the channel is "done", any pending sends will be completed normally. If the
  * channel is in an "error" state, pending sends will be interrupted and will return with the reason for the closure.
  *
  * In case the channel is closed, a [[ChannelClosedException]] is thrown. Alternatively, you can use the `orClosed` method variants (e.g.
  * [[sendOrClosed]], [[receiveOrClosed]]), which don't throw exceptions, but return a union type which includes one of [[ChannelClosed]]
  * values. Such a union type can be further converted to an exception, [[Either]] or [[Try]] using one of the extension methods in
  * [[ChannelClosedUnion]].
  *
  * @tparam T
  *   The type of the values processed by the channel.
