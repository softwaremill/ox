/** Describes an asynchronous transformation pipeline. When run, emits elements of type `T`.
  *
  * A flow is lazy - evaluation happens only when it's run.
  *
  * Flows can be created using the [[Flow.usingSink]], [[Flow.fromValues]] and other `Flow.from*` methods, [[Flow.tick]] etc.
  *
  * Transformation stages can be added using the available combinators, such as [[Flow.map]], [[Flow.async]], [[Flow.grouped]], etc. Each
  * such method returns a new immutable `Flow` instance.
  *
  * Running a flow is possible using one of the `run*` methods, such as [[Flow.runToList]], [[Flow.runToChannel]] or [[Flow.runFold]].
